A small cat saw a big dog in the yard.
At first, it felt scared, but then it stood tall.
The dog walked away, and the cat felt proud.
From that day, the cat knew it could be brave.
Once upon a time, a hungry fox tried to catch a clever rabbit.
The rabbit quickly ran into a small hole that was too tiny for the fox.
The fox waited outside all day but couldn't reach the rabbit.
The rabbit laughed and hopped away safely, proud of its cleverness.
